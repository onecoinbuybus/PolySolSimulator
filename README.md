# PolySolSimulator
Automatic Tool for All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Polymer-Solvent Systems Based on Radonpy

## Introduction
PolySolSimulator is an automated library for running equilibration molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations of polymer-solvent mixed systems. By inputting the SMILES of the polymer and solvent, along with parameters such as polymer length, the library automatically creates a mixed cell and conducts simulations. It can calculate the radius of gyration (Rg) and end-to-end distance of the polymer within the solvent.
